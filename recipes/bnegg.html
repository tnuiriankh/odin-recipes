        <li>Step 4: Beat eggs and milk together in a bowl; ladle into muffin cups. Top 4 of the egg portions with 1 tablespoon each of the green onion, 4 with 1 tablespoon each jalapeno pepper, and 4 each with 1 tablespoon roasted red pepper.

        <li>Step 5: Bake in preheated oven until only slightly moist on top, about 20 minutes. Season the muffins with salt and pepper; top with Cheddar cheese. Continue baking until the cheese melts, about 5 minutes more.
